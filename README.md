# RecycleBuddy
Ever been confused by the little numbers on the bottom of plastic bottles? Not sure if you can recycle a certain bottle because the glass isn't clear? RecycleBuddy is here to be your guide! Just scan the barcode of an item that you're about to recycle, and RecycleBuddy will tell you whether or not that material is allowed in your recycling bin. The app checks your location to find out what materials are recyclable by your city or municipality. Reduce your uncertainty about recycling, and you'll reduce your carbon footprint!

## Tech info
The front end is made with React Native, written with TypeScript.

I'm also using the react-redux library for global state management. This is currently used for location data and material info.

The backend for this app is made with Google's Firebase - specifically, a Cloud Firestore database.

## User guide
TODO: add guide for navigating screens in the app?

## Getting started (for developers)
You will need the following files to build and run this app:
- apiKey.ts - this hold an api key for Google Maps places api
- google-services.json - this holds data for the Firebase database
